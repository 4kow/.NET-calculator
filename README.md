This is a calculator app created in .NET technology. It handles basic and more advanced mathematical operations. It is also protected from errors like when user would
try to divide by zero or use the mathematical function without giving a specific digit the calculator can work with. 

The creation of this application was a task on my studies given by my professor to pass the subject. When developing this application I learned about how to make an application using .NET technology and I realized about how much work has to be done to realize even simple tasks. Creating such application is a part of gaining experience as a beginner programmer and acquiring new skills.
